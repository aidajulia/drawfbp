/* This is not the THREADS internal structure - this 
is a structured representation of the free-form connection list

Using fibres...

This test case took 11 secs with 2,000,000 IPs, and connection capacity of 50; 
assuming create/destroy trivial, send/receive pair takes 110 nanoseconds

Only uses one processor

Using Boost...

       25 secs        - this suggests that send/receive is quite a bit slower!

Uses all 4 processors

  However, there may be too few processes, so we will add 5 more, giving 11 processes, and see what happens...
  We still have 2,000,000 IPs, so 2,000,000 creates and destroys each, 10 sends and receives for each IP

  Took 18 secs - maybe 25 secs was bug!  That seems much better - twice as many processes and not a lot more time...!
